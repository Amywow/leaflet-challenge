# Project Name: leaflet-challenge

---

## Description

This project  builds a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. It develops a way to visualize USGS (The United States Geological Survey) data that will allow it to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet. The geojson file is from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php (All Earthquakes Past 7 Days). The index.html will lead to website page with outputs. Inside the static folder, there is one folder called css which contains style.css, the format of html. Another folder called js includes logic.js which is the main code.

## Usage

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Import index.html, logic.js and style.css
3. View the code (or change) on VS code
4. Check final outputs by directly open index.html by broswer
